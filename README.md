# Instaslam_jQuery
## An exercise in converting to jQuery and planting an easter egg
This project is based on a separate repository of mine called "Instaslam", which in turn takes its inspiration from the popular photo-sharing app Instagram. It is expanded upon my original project in two ways:

* where possible, vanilla JavaScript has been converted into jQuery objects, and
* I incorporated an easter egg that adjusts the overlay background color. Here's a hint: the magic word is "konamito"!

Here's the design challenges:

> ## jQuery exercise
> Take your Instagram clone and:

> * make a new JavaScript file in your scripts folder
> * edit your index.html file to refer to this new JavaScript file
> * also, add a script tag for jQuery, placing it before your other script tag
> * rewrite your JavaScript, but using jQuery

> ## Advanced DOM challenge
> The ["Konami code"](http://contra.wikia.com/wiki/Konami_Code) is a cheat code found in early Nintendo games.
> Add an [Easter egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)) to your instagram clone.
> If the Konami code is entered on the keyboard, take all of your photos and apply a ridiculously gratuitous CSS animation to them.
